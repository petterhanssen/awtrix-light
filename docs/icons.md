### AWTRIX 3 App

With the AWTRIX 3 app, available for both Android and iOS, you gain exclusive access to the official AWTRIX database, featuring over 1500 icons and animations in 8x8 and 32x8 formats. The app also allows you to create your own icons and to upload them directly to your AWTRIX device or to the cloud database.

### Custom Icons

You can create custom icons using any image editing tool and upload them via the web interface's file browser to the "ICONS" folder. Ensure that the icons adhere to the following specifications:

- **GIF**: Maximum size of 32x8 pixels.
- **JPG**: Maximum size of 8x8 pixels.

### Important Note

The AWTRIX GIF renderer currently supports only 8-bit GIFs without transparency. If you experience graphic glitches on the matrix, try replacing transparent pixels with solid black using an online tool such as [Online GIF Tools](https://onlinegiftools.com/add-gif-background).
