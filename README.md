**AWTRIX 3 is an openâ€‘source custom firmware for the [Ulanzi Smart Pixel clock TC001](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882?ref=28e02dxl) or as upgrade for the old AWTRIX 2 Mainboard and even self build matrix clock**

**Note: This Firmware is only compatible with ESP32**

You can get an Ulanzi TC001 [here](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882?ref=28e02dxl) (affiliate link)

AWTRIX3 meant to be a companion for your smarthome like HomeAssistant, IOBroker, FHEM, NodeRed and so on.    
Even if you don't have a Smarthome system, but would like to experiment with NodeRed or N8N, you are still welcome to join us.  
Our discord community, with over 5000 people, are willing to help you!  

It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity pages pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.    

However, for those with more advanced skills, the customization options available with customapps and mqtt commands allows you to take AWTRIX 3 to its full potential.  

**Note:  
In AWTRIX, the term 'Apps' does not refer to traditional smartphone apps that you download and install. Instead, in AWTRIX, CustomApps function more like dynamic pages that rotate within the App loop of the display. These pages do not store or execute their own logic; instead, they display content that is sent from an external system, such as a smarthome.  This content must be transmitted using MQTT or HTTP protocols via the CustomApp API.    
It is important to note that all the logic for managing the content displayed in these CustomApps needs to be handled by your external system. AWTRIX only provides the platform for displaying the information. You have the flexibility to update the content shown on your CustomApps in real-time at any moment, making it a versatile tool for displaying personalized information in your smarthome setup.**

# Support  
If you want to support my work, I really appreciate your donation!
All the money will be allocated towards purchasing new hardware for testing purposes, software licenses, server costs, and a significant portion will also be set aside for dinners and trips with my wife and kids so that they can continue to endure the many hours I spend programming :)
